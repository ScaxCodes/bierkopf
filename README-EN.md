# Bierkopf Tracker 🃏🍻

Our tracker for the German card game "Schafkopf". Here you can not only keep track of games and bets, but also count the beer consumption 😜🍻.

## Features

- **Start a new game**: Simply enter the names of the players and start a new round.
- **Game control**: Add games, change bet sizes, and keep track of the beer rounds.
- **Player display**: Here you can see the names of the players and their current balances.
- **Game history**: This lists all the details of past games, including winning and losing teams, bet sizes, and how much beer was consumed.

## Future features and ideas

- **Additional game modes:** Solo games, weddings, Ramsch
- **Additional calculation factors:** Laufende, Schneider, Schwarz, Doppeln (double)
- **Bavarian background image**: Gives the game an authentic Bavarian flair with a suitable background image.
- **Effects based on beer rounds**: These make the gaming experience more lively, based on the number of beer rounds. For example, the background could become very blurry and wobbly after the 5th beer round.
- **Small Söder Easter egg**: Markus Söder will be integrated. After the 5th beer, he hides in a corner, and when you hover over him with the mouse, he jumps out with a random phrase.

## Usage

1. Enter the names of the players and start a new game.
2. Add games, change the bet as needed, and keep an eye on the beer consumption.
